# Dalila Hannouche – Front-End Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio project built with **React + Vite**.  
It was **inspired by the Zentry template**, and then extensively customized and extended to showcase my design sensibility and front-end skills.

## What I changed / added

- Custom visual design: new color palette, typography, and layout.
- New interactive components and animations.
- Improved accessibility and responsive behavior.
- ESLint and project configuration tuned for maintainability.

## Tech

- React, Vite
- ESLint
- (optionally) TypeScript

> This project demonstrates my ability to adapt existing ideas and turn them into original, production‑ready interfaces.
